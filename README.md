# YouTube Downloader

This project provides a flexible setup to download either an entire YouTube playlist or a single video using Docker and `yt-dlp`.

**Disclaimer**: This tool is intended for **personal use only** with YouTube assets that you own or have permission to manage. Unauthorized downloading of content you do not own may violate YouTubeâ€™s Terms of Service. Please use responsibly and respect intellectual property rights.

**Docker Image**: The project Docker image can be pulled from Docker Hub at [hillseditor/dl_yt](https://hub.docker.com/r/hillseditor/dl_yt).

## Project Structure

- **playlist_downloader/**: Contains files for downloading a playlist.
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file for the `playlist_downloader` service.
  - `playlist.sh`: Shell script to handle the playlist download logic.
- **video_downloader/**: Contains files for downloading a single video.
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file for the `video_downloader` service.
  - `video.sh`: Shell script to handle the single video download logic.
- **downloads/**: Shared directory for storing downloaded videos and transcripts.
- **script/**: Contains `transcribe_script.py` for transcription functionality.
- **Dockerfile**: Shared Dockerfile for both playlist and video downloads.
- **requirements.txt**: Shared dependencies file.
- **.script**: Bash script to initiate both playlist and single video downloads, with an optional transcription flag.

## Requirements

- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **Bash** (for running the script)
- **WSL** (for Windows users)
- **macOS/Linux Terminal** (for Mac or Linux users)

## Environment Setup

### 1. Running on macOS or Linux

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**:
   - On **Mac**, download [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and install it.
   - On **Linux**, use your package manager to install Docker and Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update           # For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
     sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
     ```
   - Add your user to the Docker group (on Linux):
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
     ```
   - Restart your terminal session to apply the changes.

2. **Verify Docker Installation**:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

### 2. Running on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

1. **Enable WSL**:
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
     ```powershell
     wsl --install
     ```
   - Restart your computer if prompted.

2. **Install Docker Desktop**:
   - Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Windows.
   - Enable "Use the WSL 2 based engine" in Docker Desktop settings.

3. **Install Docker and Docker Compose in WSL**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
   ```
   - Add your user to the Docker group:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
     ```
   - Restart WSL to apply the changes.

4. **Verify Docker Installation**:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

## How to Use

### 1. Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x .script
```

### 2. Run the script

#### Download a YouTube Playlist
```bash
./.script playlist "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=${PLAYLIST_ID}"
```

#### Download a Single YouTube Video
```bash
./.script video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${VIDEO_ID}"
```

#### Process Local Videos for Transcription
```bash
./.script local "./downloads/transcribe/"
```

## Description
The `.script` file automatically determines whether to download a YouTube playlist or a single video based on the command-line arguments. It also supports an optional transcription flag (`-t`) for both types of downloads.

### Example Commands
  - Download a playlist:
    ```bash
    ./.script playlist "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=${PLAYLIST_ID}"
    ```
  - Download a single video:
    ```bash
    ./.script video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${VIDEO_ID}"
    ```
  - Process Local Videos for Transcription:
    ```bash
    ./.script local "./downloads/transcribe/"
    ```
  - To extract transcripts from audio files:
    ```bash
    ./.script audio "./downloads/audio/"
    ```
## How It Works

- The `.script` uses Docker Compose to run a containerized environment for downloading the specified playlist or video.
- The downloaded files are stored in the shared `downloads` directory, accessible from the host machine.
- Replace `${PLAYLIST_ID}` or `${VIDEO_ID}` in commands with actual YouTube playlist or video IDs.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission issues in the `downloads` directory, you can reset ownership with:
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(id -gn $USER) downloads
```

## Notes

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running on your system.
- Use valid YouTube URLs for successful downloads.
- If using WSL, make sure Docker Desktop is running and integrated with WSL.

## Project Updates

**November 21, 2024**

- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improved the application's ability to gracefully handle and log errors, especially when encountering private or hidden videos within playlists. This ensures uninterrupted processing of available videos.

- **Logging Enhancements:** Updated the logging mechanism to direct error logs to `error_log.txt` within the `/downloads` directory. This change resolves previous permission issues and ensures that logs are properly recorded.
